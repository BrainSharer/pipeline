1. Versioning, especially for annotations.

Duane: At best we would benefit from HA architecture (dual RDBMS w/ load balancer in between) and regular backups.  For the annotations, I believe a simple table would be sufficient to store the changes with a structure:

PK – int(11) or hash of change (sha256)
Delta of change – diff or other
Prior entry (parent)
New entry (child)  /* if this is a forward pointer, then don't we need
more than one */
