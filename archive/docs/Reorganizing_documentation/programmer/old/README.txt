There are many text files in this directory, it is very hard to know
what is in them based on the file name.

To make the documentation readable we need to:
1. Move to subdirectory old/ files that are not longer relevant.
2. Consolidate files / put in sub-directories (Neuroglancer, django, database).
3. Rename files to represent their content
4. Write a high level description file  with pointers to the low level files.
