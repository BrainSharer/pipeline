#### 1. Downsample the full resolution image using `:convert input_file_name -resize 12.5% -compress lzw output_file_path`
12.5% is the percentage of the resulting file size of the original, in this case 12.5% = 0.125 = 1/8 where the files are downsampled to 1/8 of the original size.
#### 2. Nevigate to http://muralis.dk.ucsd.edu/tasks?page=1 and create a new task by clicking the blue button on the top right.
upload images,create title and create some tags for this task.  The downsampling factor should be added as a tag for documentation purpose.
#### 3. Finish creating the task
