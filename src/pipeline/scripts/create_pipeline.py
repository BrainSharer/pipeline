"""This program will create everything.
The only required argument is the animal and step. By default it will work on channel=1
and downsample = True. Run them in this sequence:

- python src/pipeline/scripts/create_pipeline.py --animal DKXX --task
- python src/pipeline/scripts/create_pipeline.py --animal DKXX channel 2|3 --task
- python src/pipeline/scripts/create_pipeline.py --animal DKXX channel 1 downsample false --task
- python src/pipeline/scripts/create_pipeline.py --animal DKXX channel 2|3 downsample false --task

Explanation for the tasks:

- extract - Metadata from the CZI files is extracted and inserted into the database. \
    The TIFF files are first extracted from the CZI files at the standard downsampling factor, and then \
    later, the full resolution images are extracted. Web friendly PNG files are created from the TIFF files \
    for viewing in the portal. After this step, a user can verify the \
    database data and make any ordering, replacement or reproduction corrections.
- mask - Masks and normalized images are then created for the cleaning process. \
    A segmentation algorithmn is used to create initial masks for each image. These masks are used \
    to clean each channel of any unwanted slide debris. The user can peform QC on the masks \
    and makes sure they remove the debris and not the desired tissue.
- clean - After the masks are verified to be accurate, the final masks are created and then \
    the images are cleaned from the masks.
- histogram - Histograms showing the distribution of the image intensity levels are created \
    for all cleaned channel 1 sections.
- align - Section to section alignment with Elastix is then run on the cleaned images using a rigid transformation. 
- create_metrics - Each section to section alignment with Elastix is evaluated on the cleaned images. This data \
    is entered into the database for reference purposes.
- neuroglancer - The final step is creating the Neuroglancer precomputed data from the aligned and cleaned images.

**Timing results**

- The processes that take the longest and need the most monitoring are, cleaning, aligning \
and creating the neuroglancer images. The number of workers must be set correctly \
otherwise the workstations will crash if the number of workers is too high. If the number \
of workers is too low, the processes take too long.
- Cleaning full resolution of 480 images on channel 1 on ratto took 5.5 hours
- Aligning full resolution of 480 images on channel 1 on ratto took 6.8 hours
- Running entire neuroglancer process on 480 images on channel 1 on ratto took 11.3 hours

**Human intervention is required at several points in the process**

- After create meta the user needs to check the database and verify the images \
are in the correct order and the images look good.
- After the first create mask method - the user needs to check the colored masks \
and possible dilate or crop them.
- After the alignment process - the user needs to verify the alignment looks good. \
increasing the step size will make the pipeline move forward in the process.

**Switching projection in Neuroglancer** 

- This switches the top left and bottom right quadrants. Place this JSON directly below the 'position' key:
- crossSectionOrientation: [0, -0.7071067690849304, 0, 0.7071067690849304],
