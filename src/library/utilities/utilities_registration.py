"""This code contains helper methods in using Elastix to perform section to section
aligment. Elastix takes in many many different parameter settings. Below are some notes
regarding one particular parameter.

**Notes from the manual regarding MOMENTS vs GEOMETRY:**

 *The* ``CenteredTransformInitializer`` *parameter supports two modes of operation. In the first mode, the centers of
 the images are computed as space coordinates using the image origin, size and spacing. The center of
 the fixed image is assigned as the rotational center of the transform while the vector going from the
 fixed image center to the moving image center is passed as the initial translation of the transform.
 In the second mode, the image centers are not computed geometrically but by using the moments of the
 intensity gray levels.*

 *Keep in mind that the scale of units in rotation and translation is quite different. For example, here
 we know that the first element of the parameters array corresponds to the angle that is measured in radians,
 while the other parameters correspond to the translations that are measured in millimeters*

    ## use automatic scales estimation:

    ## ******************** Multiresolution **********************
    ## The number of resolutions. 1 Is only enough if the expected
    ## deformations are small. 3 or 4 mostly works fine. For large
    ## images and large deformations, 5 or 6 may even be useful.

    ## The downsampling/blurring factors for the image pyramids.
    ## By default, the images are downsampled by a factor of 2
    ## compared to the next resolution.
    ## So, in 2D, with 4 resolutions, the following schedule is used:
    ##(ImagePyramidSchedule 4 4  2 2  1 1 )
    ## And in 3D:
    ##(ImagePyramidSchedule 8 8 8  4 4 4  2 2 2  1 1 1 )
    ## You can specify any schedule, for example:
    ##(ImagePyramidSchedule 4 4  4 3  2 1  1 1 )
    ## Make sure that the number of elements equals the number
    ## of resolutions times the image dimension.
    ## ******************* Optimizer ****************************
    ## Maximum number of iterations in each resolution level:
    ## 200-500 works usually fine for rigid registration.
    ## For more robustness, you may increase this to 1000-2000.
    ## 80 good results, 7 minutes on basalis with 4 jobs
    ## 200 good results except for 1st couple were not aligned, 12 minutes
    ## 500 is best, including first sections, basalis took 21 minutes

    ## The step size of the optimizer, in mm. By default the voxel size is used.
    ## which usually works well. In case of unusual high-resolution images
    ## (eg histology) it is necessary to increase this value a bit, to the size
    ## of the "smallest visible structure" in the image:
    ##(MaximumStepLength 4)
    ## **************** Image sampling **********************
    ## Number of spatial samples used to compute the mutual
    ## information (and its derivative) in each iteration.
    ## With an AdaptiveStochasticGradientDescent optimizer,
    ## in combination with the two options below, around 2000
    ## samples may already suffice.
